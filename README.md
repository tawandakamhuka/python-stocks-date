# Using Python to find the best day to buy stocks

For this project, the famous "Weekend effect" is put to the test. The weekend effect is a theory created by financial investors stating Monday's are the best days to buy stocks as the value is at the lowest and they are most likely to perform the best.

The project is run throughout a Jupyter Notebook and makes use of Pandas.
